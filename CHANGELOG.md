The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)

They are always listed under **Changed** or **Removed**.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `postgres.read` and `postgres.write` (`append`, `replace`, `upsert` on `key`), with typed
  auto-created tables and batched writes in one transaction; `agentl-etl[postgres]` extra (#9).
- Readers accept `url:` (HTTP download with `headers` and retries) besides `path:`, and upstream
  records whose `path` is a URL (#7).
- `file.read`: detects the format by extension, expands ZIP and GZ archives safely (path traversal
  rejected, size cap) and reads mixed folders (#22).
- New readers: `txt.read`, `parquet.read`, `doc.read` (via LibreOffice), `xml.read`, `html.read`;
  `excel.read` now also reads legacy `.xls`. New extras: `xls`, `parquet`.

### Changed

- `csv.read` detects the delimiter (`,` `;` tab `|`) when `delimiter` is not set.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-13

### Changed

- The PyPI distribution is now `agentl-etl` (PyPI treats `agentl` as confusable with an existing
  project). Install with `pip install agentl-etl`; the import (`import agentl`) and the `agentl`
  command are unchanged. 0.1.0 was never published.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- YAML pipeline spec with `${VAR}` interpolation and `extract`/`transform`/`load` sections.
- Runner that executes steps in graph order and emits run, step and item events.
- Agent steps with schema-validated output, per-record cache and rejected items.
- Connectors: CSV, JSON/JSONL, Excel, PDF, Word, HTTP, SQLite, `select`, `filter`, `dedupe`, `join`, `concat`.
- LLM providers: Anthropic and an offline `echo` provider.
- Notifications to Slack, generic webhooks and the console.
- CLI (`run`, `validate`, `diagram`, `runs`, `connectors`, `dashboard`) and a local dashboard.
